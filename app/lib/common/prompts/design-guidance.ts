      CRITICAL: \`${libraryPath}\` is the canonical generic design reference library for generated app output.
      Treat this library as the highest-priority default visual reference for build requests.
      Select the closest matching reference from the library and synthesize from it before falling back to generic bolt.diy aesthetics.
      Always evaluate the full reference library before choosing a design direction.
      A valid build result must have a concrete locked primary reference from this library. Do not generate a generic design brief or generic landing page direction without first locking a primary reference.
      Use exactly one primary reference for build output. Do not blend multiple primary systems together.
      Do not repeatedly default to Ferrari, Vercel, or any other familiar premium reference unless the prompt clearly matches them better than the rest of the library.
      If a Cryzo reference is a strong or near-strong fit, prefer the best-fit Cryzo reference as the primary system.
      Do NOT default to generic AI-generated landing pages, stock SaaS dashboards, purple-on-dark palettes, or interchangeable hero sections unless the selected design reference explicitly supports them.
      Optional runtime overrides may refine the result only when they do not conflict with the selected design references.
      Every major visual decision must align with the chosen reference system first.

      LOCKED PRIMARY REFERENCE: ${primaryReference?.slug ?? 'unresolved'}
      Treat this selection as binding build direction, not as an optional inspiration cue.

    </design_primary_lock>

    <design_reference_fidelity>
      The selected primary reference is a binding visual blueprint, not a loose inspiration board.
      Preserve its signature markers, must-keep traits, must-avoid traits, section archetypes, and anti-drift rules.
      The primary reference must control page balance, layout DNA, typography aggression or restraint, palette dominance, imagery treatment, section rhythm, and interaction tone.
      Do not normalize an editorial, weird, asymmetrical, or poster-like reference into a safer startup layout.
      Do not replace reference-native chapters with a generic hero/features/testimonials/footer stack unless the selected reference itself is truly that restrained.
      Treat reference drift as a failed draft that should be mentally reworked before answering.
      If a reference depends on tension, asymmetry, awkward-beautiful composition, hard color fields, or confrontational type, preserve those traits instead of tidying them away.

            The selected primary reference is currently running in fallback mode because its canonical DESIGN.md file was unavailable at runtime.
            Follow the selected slug as binding guidance anyway, but do not pretend this is a richer multi-reference library extract.
            In fallback mode, it is even more important to avoid generic AI slop or unrelated brand drift.

      Use the first selected reference as the only primary visual system for build output unless the user explicitly asks for mixing.
      Primary reference controls composition, hero direction, typography attitude, palette behavior, CTA styling, and motion language.
      Primary reference also controls section archetypes, page balance, acceptable weirdness, and the overall intensity of the visual voice.
      Supporting references may refine spacing, polish, grid logic, or restraint only when they remain subordinate to the primary.
      If a primary reference is selected, enforce it in the final output instead of summarizing it as an optional suggestion.
      Do not describe the output as Apple-inspired, Stripe-inspired, Ferrari-inspired, or similar unless that exact reference is the selected primary or the user explicitly requested it.
      If the primary reference conflicts with generic premium instincts from the base prompt, follow the primary reference and ignore the generic premium instinct.
      The final result should look recognizably native to the selected reference family even if the content and brand are original.

            Cryzo 2 is the spatial 3D lane. It is not a generic futuristic premium design system.
            Do not let Cryzo 2 collapse into a concept-car landing page, premium EV launch page, neat dark SaaS homepage, glossy product brochure, or Ferrari-with-neon fallback.
            If the user prompt does not explicitly mention vehicles, do not introduce cars, cockpits, torque stats, speed metrics, or automotive feature sections.
            Cryzo 2 should feel like entering a world, archive, or controlled system.
            Prioritize one dominant symbolic object or artifact, strong dark foundations, oversized editorial typography, mono/system metadata, atmospheric depth, scanner or warning states, and scene-first composition.
          </cryzo_2_enforcement>

          <cryzo_2_3d_mode_selector>
            Before generating, decide whether Cryzo 2 should use true 3D mode or simulated 3D mode.
            Choose true 3D mode when the prompt implies an immersive landing page, interactive artifact, futuristic object, mythic object, spatial storytelling, experimental brand world, cinematic hero centerpiece, or concept-object showcase.
            Choose simulated 3D mode when the page is content-heavy, when performance simplicity matters, or when layered depth can be conveyed through CSS transforms, parallax, gradients, and lighting without full WebGL.
            In true 3D mode, prefer real implementation with three, @react-three/fiber, and @react-three/drei when appropriate.
            A valid true 3D Cryzo 2 result should include a dominant object, camera framing, atmospheric lighting, material treatment, and subtle animation or interaction.
            In simulated 3D mode, preserve spatial depth through layered planes, perspective transforms, glows, scanlines, hover tilt, and atmospheric motion. Do not call a flat dark page "3D".

            - it feels like dark premium SaaS rather than a spatial world
            - the dominant object or artifact is missing

          <cryzo_10_fail_conditions>
            Treat the output as failed if any of the following are true:
            - the page reads like a generic agency or startup landing page
            - the loud yellow display type is missing or visually subordinate
            - the hard field-color logic disappears and the page becomes tasteful-safe
            - the composition becomes neat, card-based, or conventionally balanced
            - the section rhythm falls back to ordinary hero/features/footer pacing
            - the imagery loses its surreal fashion-editorial attitude and starts reading like pet ecommerce or stock lifestyle content
            - 3D treatment becomes the main spectacle instead of supporting the photography and graphic type

    <design_override_layer>
      Optional runtime design overrides:
      ${overrideSummary}

      If an override conflicts with the selected design references, ignore the override and follow the canonical library reference.

    <visual_quality_gate>
      Do not consider a generated design complete unless it is visually implemented, coherent, and properly styled.
      Reject outputs that are mostly unstyled HTML, missing CSS, broken layout styling, raw text in default browser flow, or incomplete placeholder-heavy scaffolds.
      Before finalizing, verify that styles are applied, sections are visibly composed, typography and spacing systems are present, and the page reads as intentional design rather than scaffold output.
      If the page appears as bare text or default HTML rendering, it has failed implementation and must be revised before presenting it.
